## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

- Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
- Problems show where this project is lacking
- With a question you show where contributors can improve the user experience

Thank you for creating them.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- It reads well
- For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

- Provide an easy to use, lightweight and extremely fast module to build and publish typical web projects including sites, apps and PWAs.
- The module can be used in development and publishing workflows on local machines and serverless deployments respectively.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will remove things that do not respect it.
