## Getting Started

This directory contains the sample site used in the [Try It Out](../../webproducer/README.md#try-it-out) section of [README.md](../../webproducer/README.md).

## GitHub Repo as Template Source

This example shows how WebProducer can be used to generate a PWA using templates found in a GitHub repository.

## Local Developer Tool

This is a simplified version of the WebProducer CLI that illustrates how WebProducer can be leveraged in a custom build script.

## Serverless Web Publisher to S3/CloudFront

In this example WebProducer is deployed as an AWS Lambda function and triggered by a webhook from a headless CMS. The built artefacts are streamed to an S3 bucket behind CloudFront and then the CloudFront cache is invalidated.

## Web Components

See how even a complex design system can be implemented with WebProducer.
